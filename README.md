# Smooth Scrolling Example

This project demonstrates how to implement smooth scrolling between different sections of a webpage using only HTML and CSS. Clicking a button in the navbar will scroll smoothly to the corresponding section on the page.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enabled using the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` CSS property.
- **Navigation Links**: Anchor links in the navbar allow users to scroll to different sections.
- **Full-Page Sections**: Each section occupies the full viewport height, making it easy to navigate between them.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage with anchor links and sections.
- **CSS**: Styling for the navbar and smooth scrolling functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smooth-scrolling-example.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd smooth-scrolling-example

3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the webpage.

4. Click the navigation links to scroll smoothly to the different sections on the page.
